         Here’s a glimpse into my world. If you don’t already know by now my name is Josephine, but people like to call me Jo.
         I went straight to community college right out of high school then I transferred to San Francisco State majoring
         in Media and Cultural Studies. I didn't really like the major I was in, so I decided to leave and somehow ended up in CSUEB.
         Right now, I’m majoring in Art with an emphasis in Multimedia Design. I was originally from Los Angeles, but moved to the bay
         when I was 11 years old. I enjoy hiking, going to the beach, and having BBQ’s. I like to explore all kinds of stuff, but I’m no daredevil.
         I’m also into film and photography. I wouldn’t say I’m an expert, but I am learning the skills and techniques that will make me become one someday.
